# Phishing

## Idea

Since the task is to retrieve either Bob's or Alice's password, and we were given the following information:

- Bob has a dog (a bull terrier) named "Shimi," and he really loves his dog.
- Alice is a fan of mechanics. She has two vintage cars and often likes to parade around with her antique items.

I chose to target Bob, using the information that he loves his dog.

Given that this is a simulation and not real life, I assumed that Bob has an Instagram account where he posts pictures of his dog, under the username 'BobXShimi'. Thus, I decided to target him with an Instagram phishing email. The email would state that a fellow dog lover has started following him, enticing him to click the link and attempt to log in on a fake Instagram login page.

Gophish is an open-source phishing simulation and security awareness training tool designed to help organizations assess and improve their susceptibility to phishing attacks. It allows security professionals to create and send customized phishing emails to employees, track the responses, and analyze the results to identify areas where additional training might be needed. Here are some key features and uses of Gophish:

#### Key Features

1. **Phishing Campaigns**: Gophish allows users to create and manage multiple phishing campaigns. These campaigns can be tailored with custom email templates and landing pages to closely mimic real phishing attacks.
    
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: The platform provides an intuitive web-based interface where users can easily set up and launch phishing campaigns without needing extensive technical knowledge.
    
3. **Email Templates**: Users can create their own phishing email templates or use pre-made ones. These templates can include various phishing techniques, such as attachments, links, and embedded images.
    
4. **Landing Pages**: Gophish enables the creation of realistic landing pages where users are directed after clicking on a phishing link. These pages can collect data such as login credentials to simulate real-world phishing scenarios.
    
5. **Tracking and Reporting**: The tool tracks who received the emails, who opened them, who clicked on links, and who submitted information on landing pages. Detailed reports and analytics help organizations understand their employees' behavior and vulnerabilities.
    
6. **Modular Design**: Being open-source, Gophish can be customized and extended to meet specific needs. Users with programming skills can modify the source code to add new features or integrations.
    

#### Uses

1. **Security Awareness Training**: Organizations use Gophish to train employees on how to recognize and respond to phishing attacks. By simulating real phishing attempts, employees can learn in a safe environment.
    
2. **Risk Assessment**: By analyzing how employees interact with simulated phishing emails, organizations can identify individuals or departments that may require additional training or intervention.
    
3. **Compliance**: Regular phishing simulations can help organizations meet regulatory requirements for cybersecurity training and awareness.
    
4. **Incident Response Preparedness**: Simulated phishing attacks can also test and improve an organization's incident response procedures, ensuring that staff know how to react to a real phishing attack.
    

#### Advantages

- **Cost-Effective**: As an open-source tool, Gophish can be a more affordable option compared to commercial phishing simulation services.
- **Customizable**: Users can tailor the tool to their specific requirements, making it flexible for various types of organizations and security needs.
- **Community Support**: Being open-source, Gophish benefits from a community of users and developers who contribute to its improvement and share best practices.
